Helicopter
==========

An 8-hour quest to learn PyGame and Python by making Helicopter. I learned a lot making this game- how Python objects work,
what a magic method is, how Pygame handles events. And revisiting the project later with an eye for style, I got much 
better at using best practices in Python (as opposed to all globals...I'm ashamed of that now...).

If you have Pygame installed, you can play with 
```python
python main.py
```
If you don't, then use 
```python 
pip install pygame
```
and see step 1.
